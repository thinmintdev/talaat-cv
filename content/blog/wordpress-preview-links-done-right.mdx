The preview story doesn’t have to be scary. Tokenize it, timebox it, and keep editors happy.

## Recipe
1. Add a per‑post `preview_token` meta field
2. WP: Add a REST endpoint to validate token + slug
3. Next.js: `/api/preview` reads token → sets cookie → redirects

### Why this works
- No plugin mega‑config
- Tokens can be rotated per post
- Auditable and debuggable
