> App Router is fantastic—until you mix cache boundaries, server actions, and dynamic routes. Here are the traps and how I defuse them.

## 1) Caching is a contract
- `fetch(..., { cache: 'no-store' })` wins over everything
- `revalidate` propagates, but children can still opt out
- On-demand revalidation: keep IDs stable or you’ll miss entries

## 2) Streaming ≠ free
- Use Suspense for expensive components only
- Avoid “spinner waterfalls”; group Suspense boundaries

## 3) Server Actions gotchas
- Treat them like RPC: validate inputs (Zod), handle errors
- Don’t leak secrets through thrown errors

## 4) SEO and OG images
- Use dynamic OG routes, cache for ~1 day, purge on publish

## My default checklist
- [ ] Explicit cache policy per route
- [ ] All actions validated
- [ ] Streaming boundaries are intentional
- [ ] Logs for revalidate events
