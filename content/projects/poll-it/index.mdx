## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Main Technical Challenge: Real-time Data with Socket.io**
The core challenge was implementing seamless real-time communication for thousands of concurrent users:

```typescript
// Real-time connection management with scaling
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: { origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS },
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  pingTimeout: 60000,
  pingInterval: 25000
});

// Efficient room-based broadcasting
io.of('/polls').on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-poll', (pollId) => {
    socket.join(`poll-${pollId}`);
    socket.to(`poll-${pollId}`).emit('user-joined', {
      activeUsers: io.sockets.adapter.rooms.get(`poll-${pollId}`)?.size || 0
    });
  });

  socket.on('cast-vote', async (voteData) => {
    const result = await processVote(voteData);
    io.to(`poll-${voteData.pollId}`).emit('vote-update', result);
  });
});
```

### **Frontend Excellence**
```typescript
// Real-time vote updates using Socket.io
const handleVoteUpdate = (data: VoteData) => {
  setResults(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    votes: [...prev.votes, data],
    totalVotes: prev.totalVotes + 1
  }));
  
  // Trigger smooth animations
  animateResults();
};

useEffect(() => {
  socket.on('vote:update', handleVoteUpdate);
  socket.on('poll:closed', handlePollClosure);
  
  return () => {
    socket.off('vote:update');
    socket.off('poll:closed');
  };
}, []);
```

### **Backend Infrastructure**
- **Node.js** with Express for robust API handling
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable data persistence and complex queries
